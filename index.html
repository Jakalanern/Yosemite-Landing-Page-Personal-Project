      Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California,[6][7]
      surrounded on the southeast by Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest. The park
      is managed by the National Park Service and covers an area of 759,620 acres (1,187 sq mi; 3,074 km2)[2] and sits
      in four counties â€“ centered in Tuolumne and Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera County.
      Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs,
      waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity.[8]
      Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness.[9]

      Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a
      diversity of plants and animals. The park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet (648 to 3,997 m) and
      contains five major vegetation zones: chaparral and oak woodland, lower montane forest, upper montane forest,
      subalpine zone, and alpine. Of California's 7,000 plant species, approximately 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and
      more than 20% are within Yosemite. The park contains suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare
      local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.[8]

      The geology of the Yosemite area is characterized by granitic rocks and remnants of older rock. About 10 million
      years ago, the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and then tilted to form its relatively gentle western slopes and the
      more dramatic eastern slopes. The uplift increased the steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in the
      formation of deep, narrow canyons. About one million years ago, snow and ice accumulated, forming glaciers at the
      higher alpine meadows that moved down the river valleys. Ice thickness in Yosemite Valley may have reached 4,000
      feet (1,200 m) during the early glacial episode. The downslope movement of the ice masses cut and sculpted the
      U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to its scenic vistas today.[8]

      Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea. Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect
      Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing the Yosemite Grant in
      1864. John Muir led a successful movement to have Congress establish a larger national park by 1890, one which
      encompassed the valley and its surrounding mountains and forests, paving the way for the National Park System.[10]
      Yosemite now draws about four million visitors each year,[11] and most visitors spend the majority of their time
      in the seven square miles (18 km2) of Yosemite Valley.[8] The park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing
      five million visitors for the first time in its history.[12] The park began requiring reservations to access the
      park during peak periods starting in 2020 as a response to the rise in visitors.

    <h1 id="h1-two">History</h1>
    <p>
      Yosemite Valley has been inhabited for nearly 3,000 years, although humans may have first visited the area as long
      as 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.[15] The indigenous natives called themselves the Ahwahnechee, meaning "dwellers" in
      Ahwahnee.[16] They are related to the Northern Paiute and Mono tribes. Many tribes visited the area to trade,
      including nearby Central Sierra Miwoks, who lived along the drainage area of the Tuolumne and Stanislaus
      Rivers.[17] A major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake, just to the east of
      the Yosemite area. Vegetation and game in the region were similar to that present today; acorns were a staple to
      their diet, as well as other seeds and plants, salmon and deer.[18][unreliable source?]

      The California Gold Rush in the mid-19th century drew over 90,000 European-Americans to the area in less than two
      years, causing competition for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and miners.[19] In 1851, as part of
      the Mariposa Wars intended to suppress Native American resistance, the State of California funded a private
      militia to drive Native people from contested territory.[20] Trader Jim Savage was appointed United States Army
      Major and led the Mariposa Battalion into the west end of Yosemite Valley. He was pursuing around 200 Ahwahneechee
      people led by Chief Tenaya.[21]

      Accounts from this battalion were the first well-documented reports of ethnic Europeans entering Yosemite Valley.
      Attached to Savage's unit was Lafayette Bunnell, who later wrote about his awestruck impressions of the valley in
      The Discovery of the Yosemite. Bunnell is credited with naming Yosemite Valley, based on his interviews with Chief
      Tenaya. Bunnell wrote that Chief Tenaya was the founder of the Ah-wah-nee colony.[22] Bunnell falsely believed
      that the word "Yosemite" meant "full-grown grizzly bear."[23] In fact, "Yosemite" was derived from the Miwok term
      for the Ahwaneechee people: yohhe'meti, meaning "they are killers".[24][25] Bunnell's battalion eventually
      captured Chief Tenaya and the Ahwahneechee and burned their village; the Ahwahneechee were marched to a
      reservation near Fresno, California. The chief and some others were later allowed to return to Yosemite Valley. In
      the spring of 1852 they attacked a group of eight gold miners, and then moved east to flee law enforcement.[26]
      Near Mono Lake, they took refuge with the nearby Mono tribe of Paiute. They stole horses from their hosts and
      moved away, but the Mono Paiutes tracked down and killed many of the Ahwahneechee, including Chief Tenaya. The
      Mono Paiute took the survivors as captives back to Mono Lake and absorbed them into the Mono Lake Paiute
      tribe.[27]

      After these wars, a number of Native Americans continued to live within the boundaries of Yosemite. A number of
      Indians supported the growing tourism industry by working as laborers or maids. Later, Indians became part of the
      tourism industry itself by selling baskets or performing for tourists.[28] In 1969, the National Park Service
      evicted the remaining Native people from their residences and destroyed their village as part of a fire-fighting
      exercise.[20] A reconstructed "Indian Village of Ahwahnee" has been erected behind the Yosemite Museum, located
      next to the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center.[29][30][31]

    <p>
      With its scrubby sun-baked chaparral, stately groves of pine, fir, and sequoia, and expanses of alpine woodlands
      and meadows, Yosemite National Park preserves a Sierra Nevada landscape as it prevailed before Euro-American
      settlement.[101] In contrast to surrounding lands, which have been significantly altered by logging, the park
      still contains some 225,510 acres (91,260 ha) of old-growth forest.[102] Taken together, the park's varied
      habitats support over 250 species of vertebrates, which include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
      mammals.[103]

      Much of Yosemite's western boundary has habitats dominated by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar
      pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak
      and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of
      relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species
      typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink,
      white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar,
      spotted owl, and a wide variety of bat species.[103]

      Going higher in elevation, the coniferous forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey
      pine, lodgepole pine, and the occasional foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats,
      because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground
      squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but
      include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.[103]

      Marmot in Tuolumne Meadows
      As the landscape rises, trees become smaller and more sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite.
      These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast
      expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is
      short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black
      rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra
      Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a
      small, reintroduced population exists.[103]

      At a variety of elevations, meadows provide important, productive habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on
      the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted
      to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the
      proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow
      habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.[103]
